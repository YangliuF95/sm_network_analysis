## Repository structure
This is the repository for the article "Extracting the interdisciplinary specialty structures in social media data-based research: A clustering-based network approach" and contains the following elements:

- data: The search string for retrieving the dataset from WoS and MAG, and
- code: the code to generate the results presented in the article.

## Method description
This repository contains cluster analyses in three types of citation-based networks. The following table shows an example of how different approaches partition the same set of documents:


| **Citation-based mapping approaches** | **Clustering example** |

***<sub>The gray box represents the documents within a dataset. Documents Jâ€“M and N-R are documents outside the set, but are referenced by documents within the set, and cite documents within the set. Solid arrows represent citations within the set. Dashed arrows represent citations from or to documents outside the set. Ovals in each panel show how the documents might be clustered based on each approach (inspired by Boyack & Klavans, 2010)***
